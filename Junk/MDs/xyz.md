## The Problem

We do not have an Education system that encourages Research/Experiments in general. To be precise, we do not find value in it.

    We are a county of 1.3B. That means if we devide all living souls on the planet in group of six there will be 1 indian in each group. This is insane..! The other fact is we are proud of all the leaders who are Indians. Every one of us has been been part of the discussion, where ppl think that Indians are far more brainy than rest of the world. The fact of the matter is, there is no corelation between being brainy and being an Indian. In one of the press conferences Mr. Raghuram Rajan put it in great way. His view were, "If we have population ratio of 1/6 to rest of the world, then we have to have same ratio in every other thing possible.". This has to be eye opening for all of us on this matter.

## Indian Researchers

This topic is one of my favorites, coz there is huge media hype which rurrounds this subject. Alright let me prove it.

* Please GOOGLE **[how many indians are there in nasa](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=how+many+indians+are+there+in+nasa&rlz=1C1OKWM_enIN774IN774&oq=how+many+indians+are+there+in+nasa&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.455j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)** look at the TOI link and then come back.

**36%** it says.. !! Crazy, right?? But here is the problem with that article, there is no proof to back it up. Instead if you go to QUORA you might find actual result, so we'll do that.

* Quora link to [What percentage of NASA employees are Indian?](https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-NASA-employees-are-Indian).

In its entirety, above link is the pure form of research. It's first reply takes you to 2014 study which debunks TOI claim. Not only that, same kind of false information is out there about many other respected organizations also.

    This comparison provides the foundation for introspection needed. The only thing that is more toxic than not trying to improve the situation, is not even realizing that there is a problem.

## Responsibility

This is not one fold problem. And certainly no single side is responsible. Well, industry says that there are not enough qualified engineers out in the market. True, coz being engineer is eaiser than ever. Doing Engineering in India is as simple as walking into a mall and buying stuff, which if you have enough money you can do that pretty easily. This analogy is harder to accept. But it is harder to debunk. In some way or the other, every piece of this puzzle called Education is vital here coz all of them share the responsibility.

* Government - These guys certify institutions like they are out for giving free chocolates. Well sorry.. for alot of money, recovering which is no big deal for institutions.
* Institutions - Very few colleges actually care about the quality of education they provide.
* Teachers - Teachers are one of the most important piece of the puzzle. As they are responsible for creating the environment required for research. They themselves need to be involved in one.
