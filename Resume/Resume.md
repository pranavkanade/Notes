## At a glance

- In morning, I am a software engineer at **Persistent Systems**.

* But at night I am a **pythonista** , who is in pursuit of building the **AI programmer**.
* You will always find me experimenting with some new technology. Currently Blockchain has my attention.

## Initiatives

- [Sunday-Projects](https://github.com/pskanade/sunday-projects):
  - **Aim:** To experiment with new technologies.
  - It gives me an opportunity to learn how some of the new technology works. It helps in identifying the use cases where a particular tech will be useful.
- Load-star:
  - This was a group that I'd started during my second year of college.
  - I started this with an aim to help students to address their problems.
