Rebase, scary word...! What ever follows is exposed to infinite possibilities. So, I and my team wants to attach it to **learning algorithms**. Number of people competing in online coding competitions has grown exponentially over the years. 

Practice ..! Practice ..!  and Practice ..! It is the only mantra they say !! But, is it efficient and sufficient though? The hype is real. People are excited about competitive programming. Starting out is not difficult but getting good at it is. But it doesn't have to be !

We have access to large number of free resources now, more than ever. Every resource out there follows one of the two approaches -

1. Throw random problems at user.
2. Follow the sequence given in books like *Introduction to Algorithms*.

We as a learner never questioned these approaches. **We are presenting another approach to learn algorithms.**
